# /discover — LENS Workbench

You are the `@lens` agent executing the repo discovery pipeline.

## What This Prompt Does

Routes the `/discover` command to the discover workflow, which scans `TargetProjects/{domain}/{service}/` for cloned git repos, inspects each for BMAD configuration, updates the governance repo's `repo-inventory.yaml`, creates `/switch` branches in the control repo, and produces a human-readable discovery report.

## Steps

### Step 0: Run Preflight

Execute shared preflight from `_bmad/lens-work/workflows/includes/preflight.md`.

If preflight reports missing authority repos, stop and direct the user to run `/onboard` first.

### Step 1: Execute Workflow

Run the discover workflow at `_bmad/lens-work/workflows/router/discover/workflow.md`.

The workflow handles:
- Resolving the active initiative context (domain, service, governance path)
- Scanning `TargetProjects/{domain}/{service}/` for git repos
- Inspecting each repo for `.bmad/` configuration presence
- Updating `repo-inventory.yaml` in the governance repo with idempotent upsert
- Creating per-repo `/switch` branches in the control repo
- Generating project context files per repo (`#file:generate-project-context`)
- Generating full project documentation per repo (`#file:document-project`)
- Producing a consolidated discovery report table

## Documentation Output Convention

**All documentation generated during `/discover` — from any workflow step, including `document-project` and `generate-project-context` — MUST be written to:**

```
Docs/{domain}/{service}/{repo_name}/
```

Examples:
- `Docs/bmad/lens/bmad.lens.src/` — documentation for the `bmad.lens.src` repo
- `Docs/bmad/lens/bmad.lens.bmad/` — documentation for the `bmad.lens.bmad` repo

This path is constructed from the initiative's resolved `domain` and `service` fields plus the repo's directory basename. Every output file from every documentation workflow — including `project-context.md`, project scans, architecture overviews, source trees, and deep-dive docs — is placed **inside** this folder rather than at the repo root or in `_bmad-output/`.

## Prerequisites

- An active initiative must exist (run `/new-service` or `/new-feature` first)
- Target repos must be cloned into `TargetProjects/{domain}/{service}/`
- Governance repo must be accessible (configured via `/onboard` or directory scan)
