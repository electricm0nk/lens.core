# /dev — Implementation Phase Router (Epic-Level Loop)

**Purpose:** Iterate all stories in an epic, implementing each with per-task commits, adversarial code review after each story (with fix loop), epic-completion teardown, and retrospective.

---

## Role Authorization

**Authorized:** Developer (post-review only)

---

## Prerequisites

- [x] `/sprintplan` complete (large → base promotion passed)
- [x] Dev stories exist for the target epic (created by `/sprintplan`)
- [x] Epic number provided as input parameter
- [x] Developer assigned (or self-assigned)
- [x] initiatives/{id}.yaml exists
- [x] Constitution gate passed (large → base audience promotion)

---

#### 3.N. Checkout Target Repo — Initiative, Epic & Story Branch Management

**IMPORTANT:** This is where we switch from BMAD control repo to TargetProjects.

**Branch hierarchy:** `feature/{initiativeId}` → `feature/{initiativeId}-{epic}` → `feature/{initiativeId}-{epic}-{story}`
**Story chaining:** Story 2 branches off story 1 (not off epic). Story 1 branches off epic.
**PR flow:** Story PRs are created (story→epic) but execution continues. Hard stop at epic level only.

```yaml
story_key = story_id
epic_num = session.epic_number
epic_key = "epic-${epic_num}"

# Resolve initiative_id from initiative config
initiative_id = initiative.id || "init-1"
session.initiative_id = initiative_id

# New branch naming convention
initiative_branch = "feature/${initiative_id}"
epic_branch = "feature/${initiative_id}-${epic_key}"
story_branch = "feature/${initiative_id}-${epic_key}-${story_key}"

# target_path resolved during Pre-Flight from initiative.target_repos
target_path = session.target_path
target_repo = session.target_repo

# --- Fresh Pull: Sync target repo default branch before any branching ---

**Per-Task Commit Rule:**
- BEFORE each commit, verify you are on the STORY branch:
  ```bash
  cd "${target_path}"
  current=$(git branch --show-current)
  if [[ "$current" != "${story_branch}" ]]; then
    echo "❌ BLOCKED: On branch $current, expected ${story_branch}"
    git checkout "${story_branch}"
  fi
  ```
- After completing EACH task/subtask, immediately commit and push:
  ```bash
  git add -A
  git commit -m "feat(${story_key}): {task-description}

  Story: ${story_key}
  Task: {task_number}/{total_tasks}
  Epic: ${epic_key}"
  git push origin "${story_branch}"
  ```
- Do NOT batch task commits — each task gets its own commit
- Commit body MUST include Story, Task, and Epic metadata
- Push target MUST specify `origin "${story_branch}"` — never bare `git push`
- NEVER commit directly to `${epic_branch}` — epic branch receives code ONLY via merged PRs

**Remember:**
- ALL file writes go to ${target_path} (the TargetProject repo) — NEVER to bmad.lens.release
- ALL commits go to the STORY branch — NEVER to the epic or integration branch
- Follow constitutional articles above during implementation
- Follow special instructions (if provided) for all implementation decisions
- Commit after EACH task (not after all tasks)
- Return to BMAD directory when story implementation is complete
```

```yaml
if article_gates and article_gates.failed_gates > 0 and enforcement_mode == "enforced":
  halt: true
  output: |
    ⛔ BLOCKED — Unresolved enforced gate failures detected at Step 4.N

```

**Agent Implementation Flow (Per-Task Commits):**
The agent implements each task in the story sequentially.
After completing EACH task:
1. `git add -A` in target repo
2. Commit with multi-line message:
   ```
   feat(${story_key}): {task-description}

   Story: ${story_key}
   Task: {task_number}/{total_tasks}
   Epic: ${epic_key}
   ```
3. `git push`

After ALL tasks are implemented and committed, proceed automatically to Step 5.N (code review).

#### 5.N. Adversarial Code Review + Fix Loop (Per Story)

**⚠️ CRITICAL — Workflow Engine Rules:**
Code review and retrospective use YAML-based workflow.yaml files with the workflow engine.
- Load `_bmad/core/tasks/workflow.yaml` FIRST as the execution engine
- Pass the `workflow.yaml` path to the engine
- Follow engine instructions precisely — execute steps sequentially
- Save outputs after completing EACH engine step (never batch)
- STOP and wait for user at decision points

```yaml
# Pre-condition gate: verify story is ready for review
story_check = load("${dev_story_path}")
story_status_check = story_check.status || story_check.Status || "unknown"

## Control-Plane Rule Reminder

Throughout `/dev`, the user may work in TargetProjects for actual coding, but all lens-work commands continue to execute from the BMAD directory:

| Action | Location | Note |
|--------|----------|------|
| Write code / create files | TargetProjects/${repo} (session.target_path) | **ONLY here** |
| Run /dev commands | BMAD directory | Control plane |
| Read framework files | bmad.lens.release/ | **READ-ONLY — never write here** |
| State tracking writes | _bmad-output/ | Sprint status, initiative config |

**⚠️ bmad.lens.release is NEVER the implementation target.** It is a read-only authority repo containing BMAD framework code.
| Code review | BMAD directory |
| Status checks | BMAD directory |

---

## Output Artifacts

| Artifact | Location |
|----------|----------|
| Code Review Report | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/code-review-${id}.md` |
| Party Mode Review Report | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/party-mode-review-${story_id}.md` |
| Epic Party Mode Review Report | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/epic-*-party-mode-review.md` |
| Complexity Tracking | `{bmad_docs}/complexity-tracking.md` |
| Retro Notes | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/retro-${id}.md` |
| Initiative State | `_bmad-output/lens-work/initiatives/${id}.yaml` |
| Event Log | `_bmad-output/lens-work/event-log.jsonl` |

## Error Handling

| Error | Recovery |
|-------|----------|
| No dev story | Prompt to run /sprintplan first |
| SprintPlan not merged | Error with merge gate blocked message |
| Constitution gate not passed | Auto-triggers audience promotion (large → base) |
| Audience promotion failed | Error — must complete large → base promotion |
| Dirty working directory | Prompt to stash or commit changes first |
| Target repo checkout failed | Check target_repos config, retry |
| Branch creation failed | Check remote connectivity, retry with backoff |
| Dev story compliance gate failed | Auto-resolve: fix branch + PR created; merge and rerun /dev |
| Article-specific gate blocked | Auto-resolve: fix branch + PR created; merge and rerun /dev |
| Pre-implementation gate blocked | Auto-resolve: fix branch + PR created; merge and rerun /dev |
| Checklist quality gate failed | Complete checklist items or override with justification |
| Code review failed | Allow retry or manual review |
| Code review compliance gate failed | Auto-resolve: fix branch + PR created; merge and rerun @lens done |
| Post-review re-validation failed | Auto-resolve: fix branch + PR created; merge and rerun @lens done |
| Party mode teardown failed | Address party-mode findings and re-run code review |
| Epic adversarial review failed | Resolve implementation-readiness findings for the epic and re-run code review |
| Epic party mode teardown failed | Address epic party-mode findings and re-run code review |
| State file write failed | Retry (max 3 attempts), then fail with save instructions |
