# /devproposal — DevProposal Phase Router

**Purpose:** Complete the DevProposal phase with Epics, Stories, and Readiness checklist, including mandatory adversarial and party-mode stress tests for epic quality.

**Lifecycle:** `devproposal` phase, audience `medium`, owned by John (PM).

---

## Role Authorization

**Authorized:** PO, Architect, Tech Lead (phase owner: John/PM)

---

## Prerequisites

- [x] Small → Medium audience promotion complete (adversarial review gate passed)
- [x] `/techplan` complete (techplan phase merged into small audience branch)
- [x] PRD + Architecture exist
- [x] initiatives/{id}.yaml exists
- [x] techplan gate passed (TechPlan artifacts committed)

---

## Execution Sequence

# PRE-FLIGHT (mandatory, never skip) [REQ-9]
# 0. Execute shared preflight include (authority sync + constitution enforcement)
# 1. Verify working directory is clean
# 2. Load initiative config (git-derived state)
# 3. Validate audience promotion (small → medium must be complete)
# 4. Determine correct phase branch: {initiative_root}-{audience}-{phase_name}
# 5. Create phase branch if it doesn't exist
# 6. Checkout phase branch
# 7. Confirm to user: "Now on branch: {branch_name}"
# GATE: All steps must pass before proceeding to artifact work

### 1a. Constitution Compliance Gate (ADVISORY)

```yaml
invoke: lens-work.compliance-check
params:
  phase: "devproposal"
  phase_name: "DevProposal"
  initiative_id: ${initiative.id}
  target_repos: ${initiative.target_repos}
  mode: "ADVISORY"
```

### 2. Branch Verification (consolidated into Pre-Flight)

```yaml
assert: current_branch == phase_branch
```

### 2a. Constitutional Context Injection (Required)

```yaml
constitutional_context = invoke("constitution.resolve-context")

if constitutional_context.status == "parse_error":
  error: |
    Constitutional context parse error:
    ${constitutional_context.error_details.file}
    ${constitutional_context.error_details.error}

session.constitutional_context = constitutional_context
```

### 2b. Execution Mode Selection (Interactive or Batch)

```yaml
ask: |
  📋 Execution Mode Selection
  
  How would you like to proceed with this phase?
  
  **[I] Interactive** — Choose workflows and answer step-by-step
  **[B] Batch**     — Answer all questions at once in a single file
  
  Select mode: [I] or [B]
  (Default: ${initiative.question_mode})

raw_choice = user_input
normalized_choice = null

if raw_choice:
  upper_choice = raw_choice.upper()
  if upper_choice == "B" or upper_choice == "BATCH":

session.mode_switch_point = "entry"

log_event:
  type: "execution_mode_selected"
  phase: "devproposal"
  mode: "${session.execution_mode}"
  global_default: "${initiative.question_mode}"
  override: ${session.mode_switched}
  timestamp: "${ISO_TIMESTAMP}"

  invoke: lens-work.batch-process

    output_filename: "devproposal-questions.md"
    scope: "phase"
  exit: 0
```

### 3. Execute Workflows

**⚠️ CRITICAL — Interactive Workflow Rules:**
Each sub-workflow uses sequential step-file architecture.
- 🛑 **NEVER** auto-complete or batch-generate content without user input
- ⏸️ **ALWAYS** STOP and wait for user input/confirmation at each step
- 🚫 **NEVER** load the next step file until user explicitly confirms (Continue / C)
- 📋 Back-and-forth dialogue is REQUIRED — you are a facilitator, not a generator
- 💾 Save/update frontmatter after completing each step before loading the next
- 🎯 Read the ENTIRE step file before taking any action within it

**Agent:** Adopt John (PM) persona — load `_bmad/bmm/agents/pm.md`

#### Epics — Story Breakdown Integration:

  constitutional_context: ${constitutional_context}

invoke: git-orchestration.finish-workflow
```

### 4. Phase Completion — Push Only

> **⛔ MANDATORY EPILOGUE — NEVER SKIP**
> Steps 4–7 below MUST execute after artifact generation completes,
> regardless of how artifacts were produced (interactive, batch, YOLO, or
> recovery from interruption). Committing artifacts without creating the
> PR leaves the phase in a broken state. If you have committed and pushed
> artifacts, you are NOT done — continue executing from this point.

```yaml
# REQ-7: Never auto-merge. PR created in S1.2.
if all_workflows_complete("devproposal"):
  invoke: git-orchestration.commit-and-push
  params:
    branch: ${phase_branch}
    message: "[${initiative.id}] DevProposal complete"

  # REQ-8: Create PR for phase merge using create-pr script (PAT + API, no gh CLI)
  invoke: script
  script: "${PROJECT_ROOT}/_bmad/lens-work/scripts/create-pr.ps1"  # or .sh on Unix
  params:
    SourceBranch: ${phase_branch}
    TargetBranch: ${audience_branch}
    Title: "[PHASE] ${initiative.id} — DevProposal complete"
    Body: "DevProposal phase complete for ${initiative.id}.\n\nPhase: devproposal\nAudience: medium\nArtifacts: epics.md, stories.md, implementation-readiness.md\nAversarial Review: PASSED\nParty Mode Review: COMPLETED\n\n---\n*Generated by lens-work/workflows/router/devproposal. Ready for promotion to large audience.*"
  capture: pr_result

  # REQ-7/REQ-8: Phase enters pr_pending after PR creation
  invoke: state-management.update-initiative
  params:
    initiative_id: ${initiative.id}
    updates:
      phase_status:
        devproposal:
          status: "pr_pending"
          pr_url: "${pr_result.pr_url || pr_result.url || pr_result}"
          pr_number: ${pr_result.pr_number || pr_result.number || null}
  if pr_result.fallback:
    invoke: state-management.update-initiative
    params:
      initiative_id: ${initiative.id}
      updates:
        phase_status:
          devproposal:
            status: "pr_pending"
            pr_url: null
            pr_number: null

  output: |
    ✅ /devproposal complete
    ├── Phase: DevProposal (devproposal) finished
    ├── Audience: medium (lead review)
    ├── Branch pushed: ${phase_branch}
    ├── PR: ${pr_result}
    ├── Status: pr_pending (awaiting merge)
    ├── Stories ready for sprint planning
    └── Next: Run @lens next (or /sprintplan). If promotion is required, it is auto-triggered.
```

### 5. Update State Files

```yaml
invoke: state-management.update-initiative
params:
  initiative_id: ${initiative.id}
  updates:
    current_phase: "devproposal"
    phase_status:
      devproposal:
        status: "in_progress"
        started_at: "${ISO_TIMESTAMP}"
    audience_status:
      small_to_medium: "complete"

invoke: state-management.update-state
params:
  updates:
    current_phase: "devproposal"
    workflow_status: "pr_pending"
    active_branch: "${phase_branch}"
```

### 6. Commit State Changes

```yaml
invoke: git-orchestration.commit-and-push
params:
  paths:
    - "_bmad-output/lens-work/initiatives/${initiative.id}.yaml"
    - "_bmad-output/lens-work/event-log.jsonl"
    - "${docs_path}/"
  message: "[lens-work] /devproposal: DevProposal — ${initiative.id}"
  branch: "${phase_branch}"
```

### 7. Log Event

```json
{"ts":"${ISO_TIMESTAMP}","event":"devproposal","id":"${initiative.id}","phase":"devproposal","audience":"medium","workflow":"devproposal","status":"complete"}
```

### Step 8: Offer Next Step

```
Ready to continue?

**[C]** Continue to /sprintplan (SprintPlan phase)
**[P]** Pause here (resume later with @lens /sprintplan)
**[S]** Show status (@lens ST)
```

### Step 9: Check Promotion Readiness

Execute the promotion-check include from `_bmad/lens-work/workflows/includes/promotion-check.md`:

```yaml
invoke: include
path: "_bmad/lens-work/workflows/includes/promotion-check.md"
params:
  current_phase: "devproposal"
  initiative_root: "${initiative.id}"
  current_audience: "medium"
  lifecycle_contract: load("lifecycle.yaml")
```

**Purpose:** Check if promotion to the next audience (large) is available after devproposal completion (since devproposal has `auto_advance_promote: true` and `branching_audience: medium`). If all phases for the current audience are complete, offer the promote workflow.

| PRD/Architecture missing | Warn, proceeding may produce incomplete epics |
| Dirty working directory | Prompt to stash or commit changes first |
| Branch creation failed | Check remote connectivity, retry with backoff |
| Audience promotion check failed | Auto-triggers `@lens promote`, then pauses for gate completion |
| Epic/Story generation failed | Retry or allow manual creation |
| Epic adversarial review failed | Resolve implementation-readiness findings and re-run /plan |
| Epic party-mode review failed | Address party-mode findings and re-run /plan |
| State file write failed | Retry (max 3 attempts), then fail with save instructions |
