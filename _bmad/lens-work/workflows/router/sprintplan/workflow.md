# /sprintplan — SprintPlan Phase Router

**Purpose:** Validate readiness, run sprint planning, create dev-ready stories, and hand off to developers.

**Lifecycle:** `sprintplan` phase, audience `large` (stakeholder approval), owned by Bob (Scrum Master).

---

## Role Authorization

**Authorized:** Scrum Master (phase owner: Bob/SM)

---

## Prerequisites

- [x] Medium → Large audience promotion complete (stakeholder-approval gate passed)
- [x] `/devproposal` complete (devproposal phase merged into medium audience branch)
- [x] Stories exist
- [x] devproposal gate passed (DevProposal artifacts committed)

---

## Execution Sequence

### 0. Pre-Flight [REQ-9]

```yaml
# PRE-FLIGHT (mandatory, never skip) [REQ-9]
# 0. Execute shared preflight include (authority sync + constitution enforcement)
# 1. Verify working directory is clean
# 2. Derive initiative state from git branch (v2: git-state skill)
# 3. Validate audience promotion (medium → large must be complete)
# 4. Determine correct phase branch: {initiative_root}-{audience}-{phase_name}
# 5. Create phase branch if it doesn't exist
# 6. Checkout phase branch
# 7. Confirm to user: "Now on branch: {branch_name}"
# GATE: All steps must pass before proceeding to sprint planning

### 1. Validate Prerequisites & Gate Check

```yaml
# Gate check — verify devproposal phase is complete and medium→large promotion done
devproposal_branch = "${initiative_root}-medium-devproposal"
medium_branch = "${initiative_root}-medium"

result = git-orchestration.exec("git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/${devproposal_branch} origin/${medium_branch}")

  output: |
    ⏳ Audience promotion (medium → large) still incomplete
    ▶️  Auto-triggering audience promotion now
  invoke_command: "@lens promote"
  exit: 0
```

### 1a. Checklist Enforcement — Verify Required Artifacts

```yaml
required_artifacts:
  - path: "${docs_path}/product-brief.md"
    phase: "preplan"
    name: "Product Brief"
  - path: "${docs_path}/prd.md"
    phase: "businessplan"
    name: "PRD"
  - path: "${docs_path}/architecture.md"
    phase: "techplan"
    name: "Architecture"
  - path: "${docs_path}/epics.md"
    phase: "devproposal"
    name: "Epics"
  - path: "${docs_path}/stories.md"
    phase: "devproposal"
    name: "Stories"
  - path: "${docs_path}/readiness-checklist.md"
    phase: "devproposal"
    name: "Readiness Checklist"

missing = []
for artifact in required_artifacts:
  if not file_exists(artifact.path):
    missing.append("${artifact.name} (${artifact.phase}): ${artifact.path}")

if missing.length > 0:
  output: |
    ⚠️ Missing required artifacts:
    ${missing.join("\n")}

    These must exist before passing the sprint planning gate.

  offer: "Continue anyway? [Y]es / [N]o — (choosing Yes will mark gate as 'passed_with_warnings')"
```

### 1b. Constitutional Context Injection (Required)

```yaml
constitutional_context = invoke("constitution.resolve-context")

if constitutional_context.status == "parse_error":
  error: |
    Constitutional context parse error:
    ${constitutional_context.error_details.file}
    ${constitutional_context.error_details.error}

session.constitutional_context = constitutional_context
```

### 2. Re-run Readiness Checklist

```yaml
# RESOLVED: bmm.readiness-checklist → Read fully and follow:
#   _bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/check-implementation-readiness/workflow.md
# Run in validate mode (check existing artifacts, don't create new ones)
# Agent persona: Bob (Scrum Master) — _bmad/bmm/agents/sm.md
read_and_follow: "_bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/check-implementation-readiness/workflow.md"
params:
  mode: "validate"
  constitutional_context: ${constitutional_context}

if readiness.blockers > 0:
  output: |
    ⚠️ Readiness blockers found:
    ${readiness.blockers}

    Resolve blockers before proceeding to sprint planning.
  exit: 1
```

### 2a. Constitutional Compliance Gate (Required)

```yaml
compliance_targets:
  - path: "${docs_path}/product-brief.md"
    type: "PRD"
  - path: "${docs_path}/prd.md"
    type: "PRD"
  - path: "${docs_path}/architecture.md"
    type: "Architecture document"
  - path: "${docs_path}/epics.md"
    type: "Story/Epic"
  - path: "${docs_path}/stories.md"
    type: "Story/Epic"
  - path: "${docs_path}/readiness-checklist.md"
    type: "Story/Epic"

compliance_failures = []
compliance_warnings = []
compliance_checked = 0

for target in compliance_targets:
  if file_exists(target.path):
    compliance_result = invoke("constitution.compliance-check")
    params:
      artifact_path: ${target.path}
      artifact_type: ${target.type}
      constitutional_context: ${constitutional_context}

    compliance_checked = compliance_checked + 1

    if compliance_result.fail_count > 0:
      compliance_failures.append("${target.path}: ${compliance_result.fail_count} FAIL")

    if compliance_result.warn_count > 0:
      compliance_warnings.append("${target.path}: ${compliance_result.warn_count} WARN")

if compliance_failures.length > 0:
  output: |
    FAIL Constitutional compliance failures detected:
    ${compliance_failures.join("\n")}

    Sprint planning blocked until violations are resolved.
  exit: 1
```

### 3. Sprint Planning

**⚠️ CRITICAL — Workflow Engine Rules:**
Sub-workflows [3] and [4] use YAML-based workflow.yaml files with the workflow engine.
- Load `_bmad/core/tasks/workflow.yaml` FIRST as the execution engine
- Pass the `workflow.yaml` path to the engine
- Follow engine instructions precisely — execute steps sequentially
- Save outputs after completing EACH engine step (never batch)
- STOP and wait for user at decision points

**Agent:** Adopt Bob (Scrum Master) persona — load `_bmad/bmm/agents/sm.md`

```yaml
invoke: git-orchestration.start-workflow
params:
  workflow_name: sprint-planning

# RESOLVED: bmm.sprint-planning → Load workflow engine then execute YAML workflow:
#   1. Load engine: _bmad/core/tasks/workflow.yaml
#   2. Pass config: _bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/sprint-planning/workflow.yaml
# Agent persona: Bob (Scrum Master) — _bmad/bmm/agents/sm.md
# Engine executes steps sequentially — save outputs after EACH step
# STOP and wait for user at decision points
agent_persona: "_bmad/bmm/agents/sm.md"
load_engine: "_bmad/core/tasks/workflow.yaml"
execute_workflow: "_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/sprint-planning/workflow.yaml"
params:
  stories: "${docs_path}/stories.md"
  output_path: "${bmad_docs}"
  constitutional_context: ${constitutional_context}

invoke: git-orchestration.finish-workflow

output: |
  📋 Sprint Planning
  ├── Stories prioritized
  ├── Capacity allocated
  ├── Sprint backlog: ${bmad_docs}/sprint-backlog.md
  └── Sprint backlog created
```

### 4. Create Dev-Ready Story

```yaml
invoke: git-orchestration.start-workflow
params:
  workflow_name: dev-story

# RESOLVED: bmm.create-dev-story → Load workflow engine then execute YAML workflow:
#   1. Load engine: _bmad/core/tasks/workflow.yaml
#   2. Pass config: _bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/create-story/workflow.yaml
# Agent persona: Bob (Scrum Master) — _bmad/bmm/agents/sm.md
# Engine executes steps sequentially — save outputs after EACH step
# STOP and wait for user at decision points
load_engine: "_bmad/core/tasks/workflow.yaml"
execute_workflow: "_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/create-story/workflow.yaml"
params:
  story_id: "${selected_story}"
  output_path: "${bmad_docs}"
  constitutional_context: ${constitutional_context}

invoke: git-orchestration.finish-workflow

output: |
  📝 Dev Story Created
  ├── Story: ${story_id}
  ├── Location: ${bmad_docs}/dev-story-${story_id}.md
  ├── Acceptance Criteria: ✅
  ├── Technical Notes: ✅
  └── Ready for developer pickup
```

### 5. Phase Completion — Push & PR

> **⛔ MANDATORY EPILOGUE — NEVER SKIP**
> Steps 5–8 below MUST execute after artifact generation completes,
> regardless of how artifacts were produced (interactive, batch, YOLO, or
> recovery from interruption). Committing artifacts without creating the
> PR leaves the phase in a broken state. If you have committed and pushed
> artifacts, you are NOT done — continue executing from this point.

```yaml
# REQ-7: Never auto-merge. PR created.
invoke: git-orchestration.commit-and-push
params:
  branch: ${phase_branch}
  message: "[${initiative.id}] SprintPlan complete"

# REQ-8: Create PR for phase merge using create-pr script (PAT + API, no gh CLI)
invoke: script
script: "${PROJECT_ROOT}/_bmad/lens-work/scripts/create-pr.ps1"  # or .sh on Unix
params:
  SourceBranch: ${phase_branch}
  TargetBranch: ${audience_branch}
  Title: "[PHASE] ${initiative.id} — SprintPlan complete"
  Body: "SprintPlan phase complete for ${initiative.id}.\n\nPhase: sprintplan\nAudience: large\nArtifacts: sprint-status.yaml, dev-story.md\nReadiness: VERIFIED\n\n---\n*Generated by lens-work/workflows/router/sprintplan. Ready for promotion to base audience (execution).*"
capture: pr_result

# REQ-7/REQ-8: Phase enters pr_pending after PR creation
invoke: state-management.update-initiative
params:
  initiative_id: ${initiative.id}
  updates:
    phase_status:
      sprintplan:
        status: "pr_pending"
        pr_url: "${pr_result.pr_url || pr_result.url || pr_result}"
        pr_number: ${pr_result.pr_number || pr_result.number || null}
if pr_result.fallback:
  invoke: state-management.update-initiative
  params:
    initiative_id: ${initiative.id}
    updates:
      phase_status:
        sprintplan:
          status: "pr_pending"
          pr_url: null
          pr_number: null
```

### 6. Gate Updates — Mark Pass/Block

```yaml
gate_status = (missing.length > 0 or compliance_warnings.length > 0) ? "passed_with_warnings" : "passed"

invoke: state-management.update-initiative
params:
  initiative_id: ${initiative.id}
  updates:
    current_phase: "sprintplan"
    phase_status:
      sprintplan:
        status: ${gate_status}
        verified_at: "${ISO_TIMESTAMP}"
        reviewer: "${user_role}"
        warnings: ${(missing + compliance_warnings).length > 0 ? (missing + compliance_warnings) : null}
        readiness_blockers: ${readiness.blockers || 0}
    audience_status:
      medium_to_large: "complete"
```

### 7. Update State Files

```yaml
invoke: state-management.update-state
params:
  updates:
    current_phase: "sprintplan"
    workflow_status: "pr_pending"
    active_branch: "${phase_branch}"
```

### 8. Event Logging

```yaml
events:
  - {"ts":"${ISO_TIMESTAMP}","event":"sprintplan-start","id":"${initiative.id}","phase":"sprintplan","audience":"large"}
  - {"ts":"${ISO_TIMESTAMP}","event":"sprintplan-checklist","id":"${initiative.id}","phase":"sprintplan","missing_artifacts":${missing.length},"readiness_blockers":${readiness.blockers || 0}}
  - {"ts":"${ISO_TIMESTAMP}","event":"sprintplan-compliance","id":"${initiative.id}","phase":"sprintplan","checked_artifacts":${compliance_checked || 0},"warn_count":${compliance_warnings.length || 0},"fail_count":0}
  - {"ts":"${ISO_TIMESTAMP}","event":"sprintplan-complete","id":"${initiative.id}","phase":"sprintplan","audience":"large","status":"${gate_status}"}

invoke: state-management.append-events
params:
  events: ${events}
```

### 9. Commit State Changes

```yaml
invoke: git-orchestration.commit-and-push
params:
  paths:
    - "_bmad-output/lens-work/initiatives/${initiative.id}.yaml"
    - "_bmad-output/lens-work/event-log.jsonl"
    - "${bmad_docs}/"
    - "${docs_path}/"
  message: "[lens-work] /sprintplan: SprintPlan — ${initiative.id}"
  branch: ${phase_branch}
```

### 10. Hand Off to Developer

```
✅ /sprintplan complete — SprintPlan ${gate_status}

The following story is ready for development:

**Story:** ${story_title}
**ID:** ${story_id}
**Assigned:** ${developer_name} (or unassigned)

**Phase:** SprintPlan (sprintplan)
**Audience:** large (stakeholder approval)
**Branch:** ${phase_branch}
**PR:** ${pr_result}
**Status:** pr_pending (awaiting merge)

**Next steps:**
1. Merge sprintplan PR into large audience branch
2. Run @lens next (or /dev). If promotion is required, it is auto-triggered.
3. Continue implementation flow once promotion gate is complete

Hand off to developer? [Y]es / [N]o
```

### Step 11: Check Promotion Readiness

Execute the promotion-check include from `_bmad/lens-work/workflows/includes/promotion-check.md`:

```yaml
invoke: include
path: "_bmad/lens-work/workflows/includes/promotion-check.md"
params:
  current_phase: "sprintplan"
  initiative_root: "${initiative.id}"
  current_audience: "large"
  lifecycle_contract: load("lifecycle.yaml")
```

**Purpose:** Check if promotion to the next audience (base) is available after sprintplan completion (since sprintplan has `auto_advance_promote: true` and `branching_audience: large`). If all phases for the current audience are complete, offer the promote workflow. After promotion to base, execution transitions to implementation phases outside the planning lifecycle.

| Audience promotion (medium→large) not done | Auto-triggers `@lens promote` |
| Missing artifacts | Warn with list, offer override (passed_with_warnings) |
| Readiness blockers | Block — must resolve before proceeding |
| Dirty working directory | Prompt to stash or commit changes first |
| State file write failed | Retry (max 3 attempts), then fail with save instructions |
| PR link generation failed | Output manual PR instructions |
| Sprint planning failed | Allow manual story selection |
