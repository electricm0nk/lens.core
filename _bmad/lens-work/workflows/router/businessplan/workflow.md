# /businessplan — BusinessPlan Phase Router

**Purpose:** Guide users through the BusinessPlan phase, invoking PRD and UX design workflows.

**Lifecycle:** `businessplan` phase, audience `small`, owned by John (PM) with Sally (UX Designer) support.

---

## Role Authorization

**Authorized:** PO, Architect, Tech Lead

---

## Prerequisites

- [x] `/preplan` complete (preplan phase merged into small audience branch)
- [x] Product Brief exists
- [x] preplan gate passed (PrePlan artifacts committed)

---

## Execution Sequence

### 0. Pre-Flight [REQ-9]

```yaml
# PRE-FLIGHT (mandatory, never skip) [REQ-9]
# 0. Execute shared preflight include (authority sync + constitution enforcement)
# 1. Verify working directory is clean
# 2. Derive initiative state from git branch (v2: git-state skill)
# 3. Check previous phase status (preplan must be complete)
# 4. Determine correct phase branch: {initiative_root}-{audience}-{phase_name}
# 5. Create phase branch if it doesn't exist
# 6. Checkout phase branch
# 7. Confirm to user: "Now on branch: {branch_name}"
# GATE: All steps must pass before proceeding to artifact work

### 1. Validate Prerequisites & Gate Check

```yaml
# Gate check — verify preplan phase artifacts exist
preplan_branch = "${initiative_root}-${audience}-preplan"

if not phase_complete("preplan"):
  result = git-orchestration.exec("git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/${preplan_branch} origin/${audience_branch}")

      warning: "Found artifact at legacy path: ${legacy_path}. Consider migrating."
    else:
      warning: "Required artifact not found: ${artifact}. Proceeding but businessplan quality may suffer."
```

### 1a. Constitution Compliance Gate (ADVISORY)

```yaml
# Invoke compliance-check to verify inherited constitution constraints
# Mode: ADVISORY (log warnings, do not block)
invoke: lens-work.compliance-check
params:
  phase: "businessplan"
  phase_name: "BusinessPlan"
  initiative_id: ${initiative.id}
  target_repos: ${initiative.target_repos}
  mode: "ADVISORY"
```

### 2. Branch Verification (consolidated into Pre-Flight)

```yaml
# Branch creation and checkout handled in Step 0 Pre-Flight [REQ-9]
assert: current_branch == phase_branch
```

### 2a. Constitutional Context Injection (Required)

```yaml
# Resolve constitutional governance for this context before planning workflows
constitutional_context = invoke("constitution.resolve-context")

if constitutional_context.status == "parse_error":
  error: |
    Constitutional context parse error:
    ${constitutional_context.error_details.file}
    ${constitutional_context.error_details.error}

session.constitutional_context = constitutional_context
```

### 2b. Execution Mode Selection (Interactive or Batch)

```yaml
ask: |
  📋 Execution Mode Selection
  
  How would you like to proceed with this phase?
  
  **[I] Interactive** — Choose workflows and answer step-by-step
  **[B] Batch**     — Answer all questions at once in a single file
  
  Select mode: [I] or [B]
  (Default: ${initiative.question_mode})

raw_choice = user_input
normalized_choice = null

if raw_choice:
  upper_choice = raw_choice.upper()
  if upper_choice == "B" or upper_choice == "BATCH":
    normalized_choice = "batch"
  elif upper_choice == "I" or upper_choice == "INTERACTIVE":
    normalized_choice = "interactive"

session.execution_mode = normalized_choice || initiative.question_mode
session.mode_switched = (session.execution_mode != initiative.question_mode) ? true : false
session.mode_switch_point = "entry"

log_event:
  type: "execution_mode_selected"
  phase: "businessplan"
  mode: "${session.execution_mode}"
  global_default: "${initiative.question_mode}"
  override: ${session.mode_switched}
  timestamp: "${ISO_TIMESTAMP}"

if session.execution_mode == "batch":
  invoke: lens-work.batch-process
  params:
    phase_name: "businessplan"
    display_name: "BusinessPlan"
    template_path: "templates/businessplan-questions.template.md"
    output_filename: "businessplan-questions.md"
    scope: "phase"
  output: |
    ✅ Batch responses processed for BusinessPlan
    ├── Questionnaire updated: ${docs_path}/businessplan-questions.md
    └── Continuing to phase completion (commit, push, and PR creation)
```

### 3. Offer Workflow Options (Interactive Mode Only)

Skip this section when `session.execution_mode == "batch"`.

```
🧭 /businessplan — BusinessPlan Phase

You're starting the Planning phase. Workflows:

**[1] PRD** (required) — Product Requirements Document
**[2] UX Design** (if UI involved) — User experience design
**[3] Architecture** (required) — Technical architecture design

Select workflow(s): [1] [2] [3] [A]ll
```

### 4. Execute Workflows (Interactive Mode Only)

Skip this section when `session.execution_mode == "batch"`.

**⚠️ CRITICAL — Interactive Workflow Rules:**
Each sub-workflow uses sequential step-file architecture.
- 🛑 **NEVER** auto-complete or batch-generate content without user input
- ⏸️ **ALWAYS** STOP and wait for user input/confirmation at each step
- 🚫 **NEVER** load the next step file until user explicitly confirms (Continue / C)
- 📋 Back-and-forth dialogue is REQUIRED — you are a facilitator, not a generator
- 💾 Save/update frontmatter after completing each step before loading the next
- 🎯 Read the ENTIRE step file before taking any action within it

#### PRD:
```yaml
invoke: git-orchestration.start-workflow

```

### 5. Phase Completion — Commit, Push, and PR

> **⛔ MANDATORY EPILOGUE — NEVER SKIP**
> Steps 5–8 below MUST execute after artifact generation completes,
> regardless of how artifacts were produced (interactive, batch, YOLO, or
> recovery from interruption). Committing artifacts without creating the
> PR leaves the phase in a broken state. If you have committed and pushed
> artifacts, you are NOT done — continue executing from this point.

```yaml
# REQ-7: Never auto-merge. PR created in S1.2.
# Batch mode must continue here after questionnaire processing (no early exit).

    missing.push("ux-design.md (or ux-design-specification.md)")
  FAIL("❌ BusinessPlan phase incomplete. Missing required artifacts: ${missing.join(', ')}")
```

### 6. Update State Files

```yaml
invoke: state-management.update-initiative
params:
  initiative_id: ${initiative.id}
  updates:
    current_phase: "businessplan"
    phase_status:
      businessplan:
        status: "pr_pending"
      preplan:
        status: "complete"

invoke: state-management.update-state
params:
  updates:
    current_phase: "businessplan"
    workflow_status: "pr_pending"
    active_branch: "${phase_branch}"
```

### 7. Commit State Changes

```yaml
invoke: git-orchestration.commit-and-push
params:
  paths:
    - "_bmad-output/lens-work/initiatives/${initiative.id}.yaml"
    - "_bmad-output/lens-work/event-log.jsonl"
    - "${docs_path}/"
  message: "[lens-work] /businessplan: BusinessPlan — ${initiative.id}"
  branch: "${phase_branch}"
```

### 8. Log Event

```json
{"ts":"${ISO_TIMESTAMP}","event":"businessplan","id":"${initiative.id}","phase":"businessplan","audience":"small","workflow":"businessplan","status":"complete"}
```

### Step 9: Offer Next Step

```
Ready to continue?

**[C]** Continue to /techplan (TechPlan phase)
**[P]** Pause here (resume later with @lens /techplan)
**[S]** Show status (@lens ST)
```

### Step 10: Check Promotion Readiness

Execute the promotion-check include from `_bmad/lens-work/workflows/includes/promotion-check.md`:

```yaml
invoke: include
path: "_bmad/lens-work/workflows/includes/promotion-check.md"
params:
  current_phase: "businessplan"
  initiative_root: "${initiative.id}"
  current_audience: "small"
  lifecycle_contract: load("lifecycle.yaml")
```

**Purpose:** Check if promotion to the next audience is available after businessplan completion. If all phases for the current audience are complete, offer the promote workflow. Otherwise, display pending phases.
