# /help — Command Reference Workflow

**Phase:** Utility
**Purpose:** Display all available @lens commands grouped by category with descriptions, usage examples, and first-time user guidance.

## Pre-conditions

- lens-work module is installed

## Steps

### Step 0: Run Preflight

Run preflight before executing this workflow:

1. Execute shared preflight from `_bmad/lens-work/workflows/includes/preflight.md`.
2. Shared preflight MUST resolve and enforce constitutional context before continuing.
3. If preflight reports missing authority repos, stop and direct the user to run `/onboard` first.

### Step 1: Detect User Context

Check if the user is a first-time user (no `profile.yaml`):

```bash
test -f _bmad-output/lens-work/personal/profile.yaml
```

- **First-time user:** Show extended introduction before command list.
- **Returning user:** Show command list directly.

### Step 2: First-Time User Introduction (if applicable)

```
👋 Welcome to LENS Workbench!

LENS manages your planning lifecycle from idea to implementation using
git-native workflows. Everything is derived from git — branches are
your state, PRs are your gates, and lifecycle.yaml is your contract.

**Getting started:**
1. Run `/onboard` to authenticate and set up your profile
2. Run `/new-domain {name}` to create your first initiative
3. Run `/next` anytime to see what to do next

Here are all the commands available:
```

### Step 3: Read Command Registry

Load `module-help.csv` from the lens-work module root to get the canonical command list.

### Step 4: Display Commands by Category

```

  /help             Show this command reference
                    Usage: /help
```

### Step 5: Handle Invalid Commands

If the user typed an unrecognized command, find the closest valid command:

**Matching strategy:**
1. Exact prefix match (e.g., `/pre` → `/preplan`)
2. Fuzzy match by string similarity (e.g., `/bussiness` → `/businessplan`)
3. Category suggestion if no close match

**Response:**
```
❓ Unknown command: `/{input}`
   Did you mean `/preplan`?

   Run `/help` to see all available commands.
```

### Step 6: Display Footer

```
💡 Tip: Run `/next` anytime to see your recommended next action.
```

## Design Principles

- Direction C (Conversational Narrative) — warmth and clarity
- First-time users get extended explanation, not jargon
- Invalid commands get closest suggestion, not "command not found"
- All ~16 user touchpoints documented
- Categories group related commands for discoverability
